                <p class="s1-p2 pad-1">"I have been using Alpha Brain daily since 2015 and find huge value in it. That
                    being said, it's a subtle benefit. You
                    aren't going to order a bottle, take some, and all of a sudden come up with an earth shattering idea
                    simply due to
                    this supplement. However, where it really shines is giving you a subtle mental performance increase
                    over your baseline.
                    If I had to make a guesstimate at a quantification of the benefits, I would say in the neighborhood
                    of 3% - 10% performance
                    increase for me (this is just to give some color of my anecdotal experience - it's probably
                    inaccurate and definitely
                    isn't scientific). The main thing I notice is that I can come up with thoughts quicker in real time
                    such as during
                    a business meeting. Have you ever said to your self, "Oh that would have been the perfect comeback
                    or idea" like 2
                    hours after the fact? Alpha Brain will help you come up with that idea in closer to real time. Not
                    to say that is the
                    only benefit just trying to give a concrete example of the types of benefits you will realize.
                    However, realize that
                    if you don't already have decent prerequisites such as good hydration, fitness, and diet then Alpha
                    Brain won't do
                    anything for you. It's a supplement, not a magic bullet. On occasion for fun, try taking it before
                    bed instead of in
                    the morning for some crazy dreams!"<br><br>- Anonymous, Verified Customer
